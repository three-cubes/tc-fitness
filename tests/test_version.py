"""The package version is single-sourced.

``pyproject.toml`` is the single source of truth for the version. The
``tc_fitness.__version__`` literal must agree with the installed-package
metadata (``importlib.metadata.version("three-cubes-fitness")``) so a tag bump
can't drift the two apart. When the package is not installed in-tree (a bare
``sys.path`` checkout), the metadata lookup raises ``PackageNotFoundError`` and
the assertion degrades to "the literal is a well-formed version string".
