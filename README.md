# tc-fitness (three-cubes-fitness)

**What this is:** the one quality check you run before your code can merge. You
run `tc-fitness run` and it runs your linters, type-check, tests, coverage,
security scan, and architecture rules, then gives you one pass or fail.

**The tool knows HOW to run the checks. Your repo says WHAT to check** — you list
the checks in a `[tool.tc_fitness]` block in your `pyproject.toml`, and
tc-fitness runs them in order and gives you a single verdict.

## Why one shared check exists

Across many repos, the quality checks used to be hand-copied into each one. They
slowly drifted apart, so "passing" meant something different in every repo, and a
fix had to be re-applied by hand everywhere.

tc-fitness is the one check every repo uses instead of its own copy:

- You run it on your laptop and get the **same result CI will give**. No
  surprises, no "works on my machine".
- One fix to this check improves every repo at once.
- A new repo gets a proven setup instead of inventing its own.

## How to add it to a repo

1. **Install it.** Pin a specific version in your `pyproject.toml`:

   ```toml
   [project.optional-dependencies]
   dev = [
     "three-cubes-fitness @ git+https://github.com/three-cubes/tc-fitness.git@v0.8.1",
   ]
   ```

   Always pin a tag, never `@main` — the version is the contract your checks
   depend on.

2. **List your checks.** Add a `[tool.tc_fitness]` block to your `pyproject.toml`
   (or a dedicated `.tc-fitness.toml`). Each entry is one step — a lint run, a
   test run, a security scan, your architecture rules. See
   [The `[tool.tc_fitness]` config](#the-tooltc_fitness-config) below for the
   full set of fields.

3. **Run it locally.** Install your full dev environment, then run the check the
   same way CI does:

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras --all-groups
   uv run tc-fitness run
   ```

   Get it green locally before you push.

4. **Point CI at it.** In your GitHub Actions, the CI job shrinks to: check out
   the code, set up `uv`, then run `uv run tc-fitness run`. The check you run
   locally is the exact same one CI runs.

## The daily loop

1. Make your change on a branch.
2. Run `uv run tc-fitness run` locally and get it green.
3. Open a pull request.

## What to expect

- **Green merges itself.** When your PR's checks pass, it merges on its own.
  Routine work does not wait for a human reviewer.
- **Red you fix.** A failing check is never bypassed. If it fails, you fix your
  change — you do not force it in. If it is green on your laptop but red in CI,
  that is a bug in the local setup; fix the setup, do not force the merge.
- **Changes to the check itself need a human.** Changing the files that define
  the quality check or CI is the one change that needs a human to approve first.
  That stops anyone — person or agent — from quietly weakening the check that
  protects every repo.

## Where to go next

- The canonical standard index: **[tc-pipelines/governance/STANDARDS.md](https://github.com/three-cubes/tc-pipelines/blob/main/governance/STANDARDS.md)**
  — links to everything authoritative. Improve the canonical standard; do not
  fork your own copy.
- **[tc-pipelines](https://github.com/three-cubes/tc-pipelines)** — the shared CI
  and deploy steps every repo's GitHub Actions calls (`uses: …/python-quality-gate.yml@v1`).
  These steps *run* this check.

The rest of this file is reference: the config schema, the step kinds, and the
library modules tc-fitness ships.

## The `[tool.tc_fitness]` config

`tc-fitness run` is the one command both CI and your laptop invoke, so the local
check and the CI check are the same by construction — there is no hand-copied
pytest/lint block to drift between a `scripts/ci/check.sh` and a CI workflow.

```bash
uv run tc-fitness run         # local: this is what `make check` becomes
```

```yaml
# CI: the reusable python-quality-gate.yml shrinks to
#   checkout → setup-uv → uv run tc-fitness run
```

You declare the check **once**, in a `[tool.tc_fitness]` block in your
`pyproject.toml` (or a dedicated `.tc-fitness.toml`):

```toml
[tool.tc_fitness]
name = "tc-agent-zone quality gate"

[[tool.tc_fitness.steps]]
id = "deps"
run = ["uv", "sync", "--all-packages", "--locked"]

[[tool.tc_fitness.steps]]
id = "ruff"
run = ["ruff", "check", "scripts", "tests"]
fix = "run `ruff check --fix scripts tests`"
next = "re-run tc-fitness run"

[[tool.tc_fitness.steps]]
id = "bandit"
run = ["bandit", "-r", "scripts", "-ll", "-ii", "-c", "pyproject.toml"]

[[tool.tc_fitness.steps]]
id = "tests"
# A `shell` step is run through the shell — use it for the exact pytest line,
# with its test dirs, `--cov` roots, markers, and `-n auto`.
shell = "pytest -q tests -m 'not soak' -n auto --cov=scripts --cov=tools --cov-branch --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml"

[[tool.tc_fitness.steps]]
id = "secrets"
shell = "git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | xargs -r detect-secrets-hook --baseline .secrets.baseline"

# The architecture-rules catalogue is dispatched in-process via the shared
# runner — no second python boot. It names your repo's RuleEntry catalogue.
[[tool.tc_fitness.steps]]
id = "fitness"
summary = "architecture rules"
catalogue = "scripts.checks._rule_catalogue:ALL_ENTRIES"
checks_dir = "scripts/checks"
dispatch = "subprocess"
parallel = true
```

Each step is one of:

| Step kind | Field | Runs as |
|---|---|---|
| command vector | `run = ["prog", "arg"]` | a child process (no shell) |
| shell string | `shell = "a \| b"` | a child process through the shell (pipelines / globs / `$(...)`) |
| catalogue | `catalogue = "module:attr"` | your `RuleEntry` catalogue (your architecture rules), dispatched in-process via `tc_fitness.runner.main_cli` |

Per-step options: `summary`, `cwd`, `env`, `allow_missing` (skip when the program
isn't on PATH instead of failing), `continue_on_error` (record a FAIL but don't
fail the aggregate — informational steps), and `fix:` / `next:` lines printed
under the step's FAIL. The full schema lives in
[`src/tc_fitness/gate_config.py`](src/tc_fitness/gate_config.py).

`tc-fitness run` flags: `--repo-root` (default CWD), `--only ID` (run a subset of
steps, repeatable), `--gate ID` (target one architecture rule inside a catalogue
step), `--staged` (the `<60s` fast tier — catalogue steps run through the *sound*
per-rule `--staged` selection, and any step flagged `skip_when_staged` in config,
e.g. a full `pytest`/`mypy` leg, is dropped), and `--changed-files-from PATH`
(the CI fast tier — same selection semantics, but the changed paths come from a
newline-delimited PR-diff file instead of the git index). This is the
fast-feedback entrypoint kairix's `safe-commit.sh --check` builds on, with
`--changed-files-from` as the GitHub Actions companion.

## Library modules

tc-fitness also ships these modules (the helpers `tc-fitness run` and a repo's
checks both build on):

- **`tc_fitness.lib`** — the merged check helpers:
  - **baseline gating** (from kairix `scripts/checks/_arch_lib.py`):
    `gate()`, `python_files()`, `main_entry()`, `repo_relative()`, `REPO_ROOT`.
  - **agent-actionable emit / YAML** (from tc-agent-zone `scripts/checks/_lib/`):
    `actionable()`, `emit_failures()`, `emit_pass()`, `load_yaml()`, `missing_keys()`.
- **`tc_fitness.ratchet`** — the unified grammar for "can only improve, never get
  worse" gates: one override min-length, one marker parser, one suppression
  grammar (see *Drift reconciliation* below).
- **`tc_fitness.runner`** *(v0.3.0)* — the catalogue-driven, repo-agnostic check
  **runner**: in-process dispatch for python checks + guarded (optionally
  parallel) subprocess dispatch for shell checks, the named verdict ledger,
  `--all` / `--gate` / `--staged` modes, and the thin-consumer `main_cli` /
  programmatic `run` API. Supported by `tc_fitness.catalogue` (the `RuleEntry`
  schema), `tc_fitness.context` (the shared file-index + AST parse/walk cache),
  and `tc_fitness.staged` (the sound per-rule staged selection). See *The
  runner (v0.3.0)* below.

from tc_fitness import (
    # baseline gating (kairix surface)
    gate, gate_keys, python_files, main_entry, repo_relative, REPO_ROOT,

)
```

### Baseline gating

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tc_fitness import gate, main_entry

# Low-level: gate a pre-computed violation set against
# .architecture/baseline/<name>-files.txt
exit_code = gate("f26-core-no-provider-imports", violations, REMEDIATION)

# Convenience: scan roots, call a per-file predicate, gate the union.
def file_has_violation(path: Path) -> bool: ...
exit_code = main_entry(file_has_violation, "f26", REMEDIATION, "kairix")
```

`REPO_ROOT` defaults to the current working directory (the repo root when checks
run from `safe-commit.sh` / pre-commit / CI). Every gating helper also accepts an
explicit `repo_root=` keyword for test isolation or monorepo sub-trees.

### Agent-actionable output

```python
from tc_fitness import actionable, emit_failures, emit_pass

fails = [actionable("kairix/x.py:12 leaks a secret", "redact it", "re-run check_f15.py")]
if fails:
    emit_failures("f15-no-secret-logging", fails)  # → stderr
else:
    emit_pass("PASS f15-no-secret-logging")        # → stdout
```

### YAML loading

```python
from tc_fitness import load_yaml, missing_keys

data, err = load_yaml(Path("manifest.yaml"))   # (data, None) | (None, "error")
if err is None:
    absent = missing_keys(data, ("name", "version"))
```

`load_yaml` imports PyYAML lazily and returns `(None, "PyYAML missing")` when it
isn't installed, so the dependency is optional — install the `yaml` extra only if
you call it.

## What v0.2.0 adds

v0.2.0 extends the surface to cover tc-agent-zone's 116-check fleet — additively,
so kairix's `@v0.1.0` pin needs no change. Four additions:

### `actionable(what, fix, nxt, run=None)` — optional 3-marker form

59 tc-agent-zone checks emit a `fix:/next:/run:` triple. `actionable` now takes an
optional fourth `run` argument; supplying it appends `; run: <run>`. With `run`
omitted (the default), the output is **byte-identical** to v0.1.0's 2-marker
`<what>; fix: <fix>; next: <nxt>`.

```python
actionable("X broke", "do Y", "rerun Z")                  # X broke; fix: do Y; next: rerun Z
actionable("X broke", "do Y", "rerun Z", "python check.py")  # ...; next: rerun Z; run: python check.py
```

### `remediation(fix, nxt, run, *, passing=None, forbidden=None)` — multiline block

30 tc-agent-zone checks emit a multiline F21-shape remediation block: the three
action markers on their own lines, optionally followed by a `Pass` and a
`Forbidden` example. `remediation` formats that block (no trailing newline),
ready to `print()`.

```python
print(remediation(
    "redact the secret", "re-run the check", "python scripts/checks/check_f15.py",
    passing='logger.info("token redacted")',
    forbidden='logger.info(f"token={token}")',
))
# fix: redact the secret
# next: re-run the check
# run: python scripts/checks/check_f15.py
# Pass: logger.info("token redacted")
# Forbidden: logger.info(f"token={token}")
```

### `gate_keys(name, current, remediation, *, baseline_suffix="-ids.txt")` — string-keyed ratchet

13 tc-agent-zone checks ratchet a baseline whose KEY is a logical id (`-ids.txt`,
e.g. `F30:my_tool`) or a path-glob (`-paths.txt`, e.g. `kairix/**/web/static/*`),
NOT a working-tree file path. `gate()` keys on `Path` objects and *relativises
absolute paths* under `repo_root` — wrong for opaque string keys. `gate_keys` is
its string-keyed sibling: same net-new-fails / shrinks-only / grandfather
semantics and the same exit-code contract, but keys are treated as opaque
strings (no `Path` coercion). `baseline_suffix` selects `-ids.txt` (default) or
`-paths.txt`.

```python
exit_code = gate_keys("f30", {"F30:my_new_tool"}, REMEDIATION)                     # → f30-ids.txt
exit_code = gate_keys("f89", static_globs, REMEDIATION, baseline_suffix="-paths.txt")  # → f89-paths.txt
```

### `min_len` floor override on the ratchet vagueness check

`is_vague_reason` and `parse_overrides` now take an optional keyword-only
`min_len`, defaulting to `OVERRIDE_MIN_REASON_LEN` (=40). tc-agent-zone's shell
directives use a 10-char floor, so its checks call `min_len=10`. The constant is
unchanged and the default-arg behaviour is byte-identical to v0.1.0 — the lower
floor is a per-call choice, never a mutation of the shared default kairix depends
on.

```python
is_vague_reason("x" * 10)               # True  — vague at the default 40-floor
is_vague_reason("x" * 10, min_len=10)   # False — clears taz's 10-floor
```

### Discovery helpers (`REPO_ROOT` / `python_files` / `repo_relative`) cover taz unchanged

tc-agent-zone reimplements `REPO_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]` inline
in each check. The package's CWD-anchored `REPO_ROOT = Path.cwd()` is the correct
shared replacement: it resolves to the consumer repo root in the `safe-commit.sh`
/ pre-commit / CI invocation paths (where checks run *from* the repo root), and
every gating helper accepts an explicit `repo_root=` for the rare case that
assumption doesn't hold. No additive gap was found here — `python_files`,
`repo_relative`, and `main_entry` already cover taz's `.py` discovery.

## How repositories consume it

To add tc-fitness to a repo, follow [How to add it to a repo](#how-to-add-it-to-a-repo)
above — pin the current tag (`@v0.8.1`) in your `pyproject.toml` and run
`uv run tc-fitness run`. This section explains how the version pin works.

Pin to a tag (git install — no PyPI publish); never `@main`. The version is the
contract your checks depend on, so a repo only moves when you bump the tag:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
  "three-cubes-fitness @ git+https://github.com/three-cubes/tc-fitness.git@v0.8.1",
]
```

or, equivalently, on the command line:

```bash
pip install "three-cubes-fitness @ git+https://github.com/three-cubes/tc-fitness.git@v0.8.1"
```

Each release is an additive, backward-compatible superset of the one before, so a
repo pinned to an older tag keeps working unchanged and bumps only when it needs
the newer surface. For example, the first two consumers pinned different tags:
kairix on `@v0.1.0` (the later additions are a no-op for it) and tc-agent-zone on
`@v0.2.0` (for the `gate_keys` / `remediation` / run-marker / `min_len` surface).

## The runner (v0.3.0)

v0.3.0 adds a **single, common, repo-agnostic check runner** that both kairix
and tc-agent-zone point their `run_checks.py` at — the structural keystone of
"one common fitness process for all repos". It is purely additive: the v0.1.0 /
v0.2.0 lib + ratchet surface is untouched.

### Thin-consumer API

A repo declares its own `tuple[RuleEntry, ...]` catalogue and its check modules,
then its `run_checks.py` collapses to:

```python
from tc_fitness.runner import main_cli
from .catalogue import RULES
raise SystemExit(main_cli(RULES))
```

`main_cli` parses `--all` / `--staged` / `--changed-files-from PATH` /
`--gate <id>` and returns the process exit code. For tests and embedding there
is a programmatic `run(rules, *, mode, staged_files=None, repo_root=None, ...) ->
Verdicts`.

### What the runner does

- **In-process dispatch** for python checks (`check_<x>.py` exposing
  `main() -> int`): the module is imported and `main()` is called inside one
  process, sharing a single `CheckContext` whose AST cache parses every file at
  most once. A check that raises is isolated into a FAIL — one crash never
  aborts the ledger.
- **Guarded subprocess dispatch** for `*.sh` shell detectors. Sequential by
  default (byte-identical interleaving with kairix's runner); pass
  `parallel_subprocess=True` to run them on a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with output
  buffered and replayed in catalogue order (tc-agent-zone's parallelism).
- **The named verdict ledger** — a `run [id]` line and a `PASS [id]` / `FAIL
  [id]` verdict per rule, then the aggregate verdict; the format kairix's F83
  gate-runner contract depends on.
- **`--all`** (dispatchable AND `run_all`), **`--gate <id>`** (one rule), and
  **`--staged`** / **`--changed-files-from PATH`** — the *sound* per-rule
  staged selection (file-local / relational / always-run), single-sourced on
  each `RuleEntry`. The hard invariant is **no false negative on a changed
  path**: when scope can't be resolved, the rule runs (fail-safe).
- A **footer hook** so a failing rule can point an agent at the repo's own query
  surface.

### Repo-agnostic by injection

The runner never imports `kairix` or `tc-agent-zone`. Repo-specific behaviour is
injected through `RunnerConfig` seams:

| Seam | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `repo_root` / `checks_dir` | where the repo + its check scripts live |
| `scope_resolver` | derive a rule's staged scope from its check script (the repo's FitnessRule-aware hook) when `staged_scope` is unset |
| `enumeration_narrower` | the repo's extra file-index narrowing for file-local staged runs, layered on top of the package-level `tc_fitness.python_files` narrowing |
| `conditional_check` | govern a `subprocess_arg_env` rule's runtime arg + exact skip text (e.g. a coverage check that needs a Cobertura XML) |
| `footer` | the line printed under a FAIL pointing at the repo's query surface |
| `parallel_subprocess` | run shell checks on a thread pool |

`RuleEntry.id` is id-agnostic — it accepts kairix's `"F26"` and tc-agent-zone's
`"no-duplicate-string"` style equally; the runner only uses it as a ledger label
and the `--gate` selector. `category` / `scope` are open `str` fields each repo
curates its own closed vocabulary for.

### Drop-in for kairix's local runner

The runner is byte-identical to kairix's current `scripts/checks/run_checks.py`:
wiring kairix's `_check_context` / `_staged_selection` / `_rule_catalogue` into
`main_cli` via the seams above reproduces the **same verdicts and the same
named-ledger text** for `--all`, `--gate`, and `--staged` (verified by diffing
the two runners' output over the full catalogue, including file-local staged
narrowing). kairix's migration is therefore mechanical: translate its `RuleEntry`
rows to the package schema, pass its three helper modules as hooks, and collapse
`run_checks.py` to the three-line form.

## Drift reconciliation

Both repos independently grew the same "can only improve, never get worse" gates
(coverage, mutation-survival, sonar-quality) and drifted on three details. This
package resolves each to one behaviour. The merged version is the
**superset-correct** choice — it satisfies every call pattern either repo relied
on.

### 1. Override-rationale minimum length → **40 chars, strictly-less-than**

tc-agent-zone's coverage ratchet treated a rationale as "vague" below **20**
chars; its mutation ratchet used **40**. The *remediation text both gates printed
to operators already said "≥40 chars"* — so the 20-char path was a latent bug
(code disagreed with its own message). Reconciled to `OVERRIDE_MIN_REASON_LEN =
40`, and `len(reason) < 40` is vague. Stricter of the two, and matches the
documented contract. **Mutation's behaviour won.**

### 2. Suppression-pattern list → **the superset, one grammar**

tc-agent-zone added `NOSONAR` (and the `//` C-style variants) to the marker set
kairix originally tracked, and the regex copies had possessive-quantifier
variations. Reconciled to the **union** of every marker any repo tracked:
`SUPPRESSION_PATTERNS` (substring markers for "flag any line containing one") and
`BARE_SUPPRESSION_PATTERNS` (end-of-line regexes for "bare suppression, no
rationale"). `NOSONAR` is in both. **The superset won** — dropping any marker
would silently un-gate a suppression one repo was catching.

### 3. Override-marker separator → **em-dash *and* hyphen both accepted**

tc-agent-zone's override-line regex accepted an em-dash **or** an ASCII hyphen as
the path↔reason separator (`[—-]++`); some kairix copies were em-dash-only.
Reconciled to **accept both** (`make_override_re` builds the parser; the
separator class is `[—-]++`, possessive to avoid backtracking). A commit that
wrote `coverage-ratchet-acknowledged: path - reason` with a plain hyphen must keep
clearing the ratchet, and so must the em-dash form. **The superset (tc-agent-zone's
looser parse) won.**

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

The test suite is the proof the merge is behaviour-preserving: `tests/test_lib.py`
pins the call patterns each repo's checks depend on, and `tests/test_ratchet.py`
pins the three reconciled drift decisions (40-char threshold; em-dash AND hyphen;
`NOSONAR` in the suppression set).

The package is self-contained: pure stdlib at runtime, with PyYAML as an optional
extra. It must never import from `kairix` or `tc-agent-zone` — it is the shared
core both depend on.
