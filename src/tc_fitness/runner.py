"""Catalogue-driven fitness-function runner — the single dispatch surface.

A COMMON, repo-agnostic runner that both kairix and tc-agent-zone consume. It
makes a consumer's rule catalogue (a ``tuple[RuleEntry, ...]``) the single
source of truth: it reads the catalogue and DERIVES the invocation set, so a
repo's ``run-all.sh`` / pre-commit / CI all consume one declaration.

Thin-consumer API
-----------------
A repo's ``run_checks.py`` collapses to three lines::

    from tc_fitness.runner import main_cli
    from .catalogue import RULES
    raise SystemExit(main_cli(RULES))

…and a programmatic ``run(rules, *, mode, ...) -> Verdicts`` for tests and
embedding. Both accept injection hooks (``repo_root``, ``checks_dir``,
``scope_resolver``, ``enumeration_narrower``, ``paved_road_footer``,
``parallel_subprocess``) so a consumer can keep its exact prior behaviour.

Dispatch convention
-------------------
Each :class:`~tc_fitness.catalogue.RuleEntry` resolves to exactly one check
script:

* ``script`` unset → the default python check ``check_<check>.py``. These run
  IN-PROCESS: the runner imports the module and calls its ``main() -> int``
  inside a single process, sharing one
  :class:`~tc_fitness.context.CheckContext` whose AST cache parses every file
  at most once. The per-rule verdict is the check's own ``main()`` return code;
  a check that raises is isolated into a FAIL, never aborting the ledger.
* ``script`` set to a ``*.sh`` → run that real shell detector as a guarded
  subprocess. By default subprocesses run sequentially in catalogue order
  (byte-identical interleaving); pass ``parallel_subprocess=True`` to run them
  on a ThreadPoolExecutor (subprocess-IO bound) with buffered output replayed
  in registration order.
* A check declaring ``subprocess_arg_env`` (e.g. kairix's coverage check, which
  reads a Cobertura-XML path from an env var) runs as a subprocess too, with
  the resolved path appended; it is SKIPPED when the path is absent.

Modes
-----
* ``--all`` — every in-scope rule (dispatchable AND ``run_all``).
* ``--staged`` — precise per-rule selection against the staged paths
  (``git diff --cached --name-only``), single-sourced on each ``RuleEntry``
  (``staged_class`` / ``staged_scope``) and resolved by
  :mod:`tc_fitness.staged`. The hard invariant is no false negative on staged
  changes — when scope can't be resolved, the rule runs (fail-safe).
* ``--gate <id>`` — one rule by catalogue id.

Output contract (gate-runner discipline)
----------------------------------------
The runner prints a named ``run`` line and a ``PASS`` / ``FAIL`` verdict line
PER RULE, then a final aggregate verdict. Every subprocess is guarded — a check
that raises or exits non-zero is recorded as a FAIL for its rule, never
aborting the ledger. Exit code is non-zero iff any dispatched rule failed.

    the static tuple remains for the single-rule case (back-compat).

            like ``--skip-coverage``). ``None`` disables the force branch.
        force_skip_lines: the exact lines printed on a forced skip (static).
        absent_skip_lines: the exact lines printed when the path is absent
            (static).
