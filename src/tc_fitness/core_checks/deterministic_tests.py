"""CORE check: deterministic_tests — test non-determinism is a GATE FAILURE.

A ~50% flake sat undetected in a consumer's coverage suite: the same commit
passed on some runs and failed on others, and the gate tolerated it because a
green-on-retry looked like a pass. This check converges that one-off lesson
INTO THE ENGINE so *every* repo inherits the same bite: a test whose outcome is
not stable is a failure the gate REFUSES to pass, surfaced with the offending
test id, not silently retried into green.

What it proves
==============
Given the (changed-scope) test roots a consumer configures, this check runs the
suite several times and FAILS if any test's outcome is not identical across all
runs. Two independent probes, both under one pinned hash seed
(``PYTHONHASHSEED``) so hash-ordering is held constant:

* **fixed-seed repeat** — run the suite ``repeats`` times in the SAME order.
  Any divergence here is pure non-determinism (wall-clock, unseeded ``random``,
  network, shared/leaked state, filesystem-order dependence) — the exact class
  the undetected coverage flake belonged to.

* **order stability** — re-run the SAME tests under one or more shuffled
  execution orders and require the SAME per-test verdicts. An outcome that
  flips when the order changes is an order-dependent test (state leaked between
  tests). Order is varied deterministically from an integer ``order_seed`` so a
  failure REPRODUCES exactly — non-determinism surfaced AS a deterministic
  failure. When a consumer has adopted ``pytest-randomly`` the same seed is
  handed to ``--randomly-seed`` (``use_randomly = true``); otherwise the check
  reorders the collected node ids itself, so it bites with core pytest alone.

Reconciliation with the loop determinism guardrail
==================================================
The loop state machine bans ``--reruns`` and the companion CORE check
``no_test_reruns`` fails any repo whose pytest/CI config enables flaky-retry
(``pytest-rerunfailures`` / ``--reruns`` / retry actions) — because a retry
MASKS the very flake this gate exists to catch. This check is the dynamic half
of the same standard and never contradicts it:

* it NEVER passes ``--reruns`` / enables a retry plugin, and
* it defensively blocks the retry plugin inside its own probe
  (``-p no:rerunfailures``) so a consumer's leftover ``addopts = "--reruns=N"``
  cannot mask a flake DURING the determinism run.

``no_test_reruns`` enforces the ban statically (the config may not ask for
retries); ``deterministic_tests`` proves the payoff dynamically (the suite is
actually stable). Spec (STANDARDS.md), gate (these two checks), and runtime
(the loop guardrail) therefore agree. See ``docs/STANDARDS.md`` §Deterministic
tests.

Repo-agnostic
=============
This module names no repo. The test roots, the pinned seed, the repeat count,
the order seeds, the per-run timeout, the base test command, and whether to
delegate ordering to ``pytest-randomly`` all arrive through the consumer's
``[tool.tc_fitness.core_checks.deterministic_tests]`` block. With NO config the
default ``roots = ()`` enumerates nothing and the check is a vacuous pass — the
same adoption contract every CORE check follows.
