"""CORE check: canonical_commit_identity — commits are authored by allowed identities.

Machine-enforced identity hygiene (Autonomous Delivery Platform SP-A / SGO-158):
every commit in the PR range must carry an author AND committer whose email is
on the consumer's allowlist (the canonical agent GitHub App + named human
maintainers), and — when name patterns are configured — a name matching one of
them (catching emoji/marker-in-name identities like ``Builder 🔨``).

The AUTHOR is held strictly to that allowlist — author identity is what governance
cares about. The COMMITTER is checked against the allowlist UNION an intrinsic set
of platform committers — GitHub's web-flow signer plus Dependabot/Renovate (SGO-198):
GitHub rewrites the committer to ``GitHub <noreply@github.com>`` on every squash/merge
performed through the UI, so gating the committer strictly would fail any scanned
range that includes a merged commit. These platform identities are always allowed as
*committers* so the check can't be broken per-repo by forgetting to allowlist them.

This is a RANGE check, not a file check: the unit of violation is a commit, so
it overrides :meth:`collect_violations` and reads ``git log`` rather than
walking files. It is repo-agnostic — the allowlist, the name patterns, and the
range refs are ALL consumer config; the engine ships no identities.

Guard-forward (decision D2): a ``cutover_ref`` bounds enforcement to
``cutover_ref..HEAD`` so historical commits made before the standard was adopted
never fail. With no allowlist configured the rule is a NO-OP, so a consumer that
hasn't opted in is never broken.
