"""CORE check: no_llm_attribution — no AI/LLM self-attribution residue.

Machine-enforced clean authorship (Autonomous Delivery Platform decision D1,
SP-A / SGO-156): agent work is authored by the accountable bot/human identity,
never advertised as model-generated. This rule FAILS when AI-attribution
residue appears in the repo — a ``Co-Authored-By: Claude`` trailer, a
``Generated with <AI tool>`` credit, an AI-vendor ``noreply`` author email, or
the robot emoji (U+1F916) that tools append to commit/PR metadata.

Unlike most CORE checks, the banned set here is **intrinsic, not repo config**:
the attribution *signatures* are provider-neutral and universal, so the engine
ships them as sensible defaults (a consumer only supplies the scan ``roots`` /
``extensions`` and, where a legitimate in-source use exists, an ``exempt_files``
entry or a grandfathering baseline).

Two surfaces share ONE detector, :func:`scan_text`:

* the :class:`FitnessRule` below scans in-repo files for residue, and
* the standalone :func:`scan_text` is reused by the shipped commit-msg strip
  hook (SGO-159) and the CI trailer-reject leg (SGO-160) to scan commit
  messages and PR title/body — so the pattern set is single-sourced and can
  never drift between the local hook, CI, and the fitness gate.

Guard-forward (decision D2): pre-cutover residue is grandfathered via the
per-file baseline (``--establish-baseline``); only NET-NEW residue fails.
