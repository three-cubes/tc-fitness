"""Precise per-rule staged selection for the fitness runner.

``run_checks.py --staged`` must give fast feedback that the STAGED CHANGE
introduced no fitness violation. The non-negotiable property is **no false
negative on staged changes**: if staging file(s) introduces a violation of rule
R, staged mode MUST run R. Speed is the goal, but a fast path that silently
MISSES a violation is worse than a slow one. When in doubt, run the rule — the
full ``--all`` gate is the merge bar, so over-running is cheap and under-running
is the only real danger.

This module turns each rule's catalogue metadata into a concrete decision:

* **scope predicate** — the repo-relative path prefixes whose staged change
  could trip the rule. Single-sourced: the explicit ``RuleEntry.staged_scope``
  wins; otherwise it is DERIVED from the rule's own detector via an injected
  :class:`ScopeResolver` (the consumer repo's hook — e.g. kairix reads a check
  module's ``RULE.roots`` / ``FitnessRule.roots``). When no scope resolves, the
  predicate is ``None`` → the rule is treated as always-in-scope (fail-safe).

* **selection class** — from :data:`~tc_fitness.catalogue.StagedClass`:
    - ``file-local`` — run over ``staged ∩ scope`` (and the runner scopes the
      shared file index to the staged files so an in-process check walks ONLY
      them). Skipped when that intersection is empty.
    - ``relational`` — if any staged path is within ``scope``, run over the
      FULL scope (a deletion of the paired artefact, or a new surface file, can
      break a cross-file invariant even when the obvious file isn't staged).
    - ``always-run`` — run unconditionally (net-new-file / catalogue-currency /
      README / path-naming — the trigger is "any change at all").

Repo-agnostic scope derivation
------------------------------
Deriving a scope from a check module is repo-specific: kairix introspects its
``FitnessRule`` ABC and import-boundary shims. To stay agnostic, this module
accepts a :class:`ScopeResolver` callable. The runner threads the consumer's
resolver through ``decide``; when none is supplied, only the explicit
``staged_scope`` is honoured and everything else falls back to "run"
(fail-safe). That keeps the common path sound for any repo while letting kairix
supply its FitnessRule-aware resolver to stay byte-identical.
