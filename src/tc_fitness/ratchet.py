"""Unified ratchet primitives — the three reconciled drift zones.

Two repos grew parallel ratchet gates (coverage, mutation-survival, sonar-quality)
that drifted apart on three details. This module is the single source for all
three, so a consumer's coverage ratchet and mutation ratchet agree by
construction.

Drift zone 1 — override min-length
----------------------------------
tc-agent-zone's coverage ratchet treated a rationale "vague" below **20** chars
(``<=``); its mutation ratchet used **40** chars (``<``). The remediation text in
*both* gates already advertised "≥40 chars" to the operator — so the coverage
gate's 20 was a latent bug (code disagreed with the message it printed).

Decision: **40 chars, strictly-less-than** (``len(reason) < 40`` is vague).
40 is the stricter superset and matches the contract both repos already
documented to operators. Exposed as :data:`OVERRIDE_MIN_REASON_LEN`.

Drift zone 2 — suppression-pattern list
---------------------------------------
tc-agent-zone added ``NOSONAR`` (and the ``//`` C-style variants) to the
suppression set kairix originally tracked. There were also possessive-quantifier
variations across the regex copies.

Decision: **the superset** of every marker any repo tracked, as one grammar.
Exposed as :data:`SUPPRESSION_PATTERNS` (substring markers, e.g. the
no-production-suppressions sweep) and :data:`BARE_SUPPRESSION_PATTERNS` (compiled
end-of-line regexes, e.g. the rationale gate). ``NOSONAR`` is in both.

Drift zone 3 — override-marker syntax
-------------------------------------
tc-agent-zone's override line regex accepted an em-dash OR a hyphen as the
separator (``[—-]++``); some kairix copies were stricter (em-dash only).

Decision: **accept both** em-dash and hyphen (the superset). A consumer that
wrote ``coverage-ratchet-acknowledged: path - reason`` with a plain hyphen must
keep passing, and so must the em-dash form. Use :func:`make_override_re` to build
a marker parser for any acknowledgement keyword.
